# Remote Script
## Overview
This is a website that allows you to execute scripts on different computers through the web browser. I made this as a part of a QUT unit in 2018 (IFB102 - Introduction to Computer Systems). I am fully aware that this is a major security issue but it was to see if I could combine a web interface with OS calls through SSH.

## Dependencies
* Node (tested on v16.13.2)

## Debugging
_This repository is being redone from scratch because of improved knowledge on how to use the NodeJS tech stack. Use v1.0.0 and follow the README there, however, it may not work because of deprecated features._

## Program Use
_Being redeveloped! Read comment above in 'Debugging'._

## Version History
### v1.0.0
* Submitted to be marked in IFB102

### v2.0.0 (under development)

## TODO
* Create a database backend
* Better comments in code
* Error catching
