# Remote Script
## Overview
This is a website that allows you to execute scripts on different computers through the web browser. I made this as a part of a QUT unit in 2018 (IFB102 - Introduction to Computer Systems).

## Dependencies
* NodeJS (tested in late 2018)
* Any modern browser

## Debugging
This program has been tested on the NodeJS version released in late 2018, without any issues. If you run into any errors please make sure you are on this version because it is known to work. If you still are having issues on the aforementioned version, just send me a message on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mattdocherty314)

## Program Use
Run the backend server with:
```
node ./backend/server.js
```
Then launch the file:
`./index.html`

## Version History
### v1.0.0
* Submitted to be marked in IFB102

## TODO
* Create a database backend
* Better comments in code
* Error catching
